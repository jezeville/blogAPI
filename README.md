# blogAPI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a comprehensive RESTful API in PHP, adhering to industry-standard practices and incorporating essential functionalities. The work encompasses fulfilling all the outlined requirements and features provided.

## Key Tasks and Objectives
RESTful API Implementation: Develop an API adhering to REST principles, ensuring scalability, and interoperability.

MVC Pattern Implementation: Employ the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, sans the View component, for organized and modular code structure.

CRUD Operations: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data effectively.

MySQL Database Interaction: Utilize MySQL database management system with PDO (PHP Data Objects) for secure and efficient database operations.

Data Validation: Validate input data using filter_var function to ensure data integrity and security.

HTTP Status Codes: Understand and utilize appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500) to convey request outcomes effectively.

Endpoint Definition: Define API endpoints with corresponding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for specific functionalities.

Project Structure: Organize project files into distinct folders such as config, controllers, models, routes, and utils for clarity and maintainability.

Dependency Management: Utilize external dependencies judiciously, such as phprouter.com for routing and PHP dotenv for secure configuration management.

Data Response Format: Return data in JSON format with a standardized structure containing status, message, and data elements.

## Additional Features and Advancements
Pagination System: Incorporate a pagination system allowing users to navigate through large datasets efficiently (with features like limit and offset).

Authentication System: Implement a robust authentication system comprising login, register, and logout functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

Enhanced Request & Response Handling: Improve handling of HTTP requests and responses, leveraging libraries like symfony/http-foundation for enhanced functionality and security.

## Conclusion
This project aims to deliver a robust and feature-rich RESTful API in PHP, addressing the specified requirements comprehensively and striving for best practices in web development.
